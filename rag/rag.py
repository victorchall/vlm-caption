_lyrics = """[Intro]
Come wit' it now
Come wit' it now

[Verse 1]
The microphone explodes, shattering the mold
Either drop the hits like de la O or get the fuck off the commode
With the sure shot, sure to make the bodies drop
Drop and don't copy, yo, don't call this a co-op
Terror rains drenchin'
Quenchin' the thirst of the power dons
That five-sided Fistagon
The rotten sore on the face of Mother Earth gets bigger
The triggerâ€™s cold, empty your purse

[Chorus]
Rally 'round the family
With a pocket full of shells
They rally 'round the family
With a pocket full of shells
They rally 'round the family
With a pocket full of shells
They rally 'round the family
With a pocket full of shells

[Verse 2]
Weapons, not food, not homes, not shoes
Not need, just feed the war, cannibal animal, I
Walk the corner to the rubble
That used to be a library, line up to the mind cemetery now
What we don't know keeps the contracts alive and movin'
They don't gotta burn the books, they just remove 'em
While arms warehouses fill as quick as the cells
Rally 'round the family, pockets full of shells
See upcoming rock shows
Get tickets for your favorite artists
You might also like
Killing in the Name
Rage Against the Machine
thanK you aIMee
Taylor Swift
THE HEART PART 6
Drake
[Chorus]
Rally 'round the family
With a pocket full of shells
They rally 'round the family
With a pocket full of shells
They rally 'round the family
With a pocket full of shells
They rally 'round the family
With a pocket full of shells

[Post-Chorus]
Bulls on parade, uh

[Guitar Solo]

[Outro]
Come wit' it now
Come wit' it now
Bulls on parade
Bulls on parade
Bulls on parade
Bulls on parade
Bulls on parade
Bulls on parade"""

_dupe = """The image shows two characters inside a vehicle, likely an airplane or helicopter.

In the foreground is Elena, she has short blonde hair and wears a dark blue blazer over a white shirt with a black tie.

Behind her is Rude, he has a completely bald head and a thin goatee. He wears an all-black suit.

The setting appears to be at night, with stars visible through the window behind them. The interior of the vehicle suggests it may be some type of aircraft or transport vehicle due to its design and controls visible in front of Rude.

system_prompt: You are to analyze an image 
  and provide information based on what is visible in the image. Do not embellish,
  and avoid langauge like 'showcases' or 'features,' preferring to focus on factual
  information. Make sure anything that is out of frame is NOT described. 
  If metadata is present it can be trusted to be accurate. Never include things
  that are not present in the image, and do not say things like 'no characters are
  visible.' Do not write things like 'No other characters are visible' or 'The character's
  features do not align with any specific character'.
global_metadata_file: ''
prompts:
- Describe the image in detail. Physically describe each character.
- Can you positively identify any characters, objects, or locations based on the codex
  or metadata? If you can identify characters, give reasons for the positive id.
- Describe the framing and composition, shot type, shot angle. For this request, think
  like a photographer or cinematographer.
- To finalize, summarize the description of the image in four to five sentences, focusing
  on factual information present in the image. Do not include any markdown, headers,
  or special formatting. Do not start with 'the image depicts' or similar.  Simply
  exclude such phrases and focus on what IS visible.

system_prompt: You are to analyze an image from the video game Final Fantasy VII Rebirth and provide information based on what is visible in the image.
  Do not embellish, and avoid langauge like 'showcases' or 'features,' preferring to focus on factual information.
  Make sure anything that is out of frame is NOT described.
  Try to use the codex to identify characters, locations, and objects, but once a character is identified you do not need to describe them in great detail in further responses.
  If json metadata is present it can be trusted to be accurate.
  Never include things that are not present in the image, and do not say things like 'no characters are visible.'
  Do not write things like 'No other characters are visible' or 'The character's features do not align with any specific character'.

global_metadata_file: "character_info.txt"

prompts:
  - Describe the image in detail. Physically describe each character.
  - Can you positively identify any characters, objects, or locations based on the codex or metadata? If you can identify characters, give reasons for the positive id.
  - Describe the framing and composition, shot type, shot angle. For this request, think like a photographer or cinematographer.
  - To finalize, summarize the description of the image in four to five sentences, focusing on factual information present in the image. Do not include any markdown, headers, or special formatting.
    Do not start with 'the image depicts' or similar.  Simply exclude such phrases and focus on what IS visible.
    Ensure it is described as Final Fantasy VII Rebirth in some way once.
